# Horiseon-accesibility-ticket

## Description

This is an on-the-job ticket to improve the accesibility of the starter code for the website provided by the University of Birmigham bootcamp. I made a few changes to the code by using semantic elements to replace 'div' tags.
Also, i made changes to the CSS files to reflect changes made to the HTML file. I left comments in both files to provide more details.
These changes make it easier for any developer to understand the code and reuse/make changes to them.

A few things i learnt include:
- Arranging code in a readable manner simplifies your workflow
- You need to put a lot of thought into your choice of tags and description
- Watch out for name clashes when defining classes
